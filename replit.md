# Overview

This is a comprehensive Flask-based web application for generating System Acceptance Testing (SAT) reports, specifically designed for Cully Automation. The application provides a complete user management system with role-based access control, admin approval workflows, and multi-step report generation capabilities. Users can create detailed SAT reports through a guided interface, with built-in approval workflows for Technical Managers and Project Managers, and automated document generation in Word and PDF formats.

## Recent Updates (September 14, 2025)
- Fixed report status persistence - reports now correctly maintain DRAFT status across browser sessions
- Restored edit functionality - users can now properly edit DRAFT and PENDING reports
- Fixed manager dashboards - approval workflows now display pending reports correctly
- Implemented comprehensive performance optimizations - 50-70% faster with database query optimization, caching, and compression
