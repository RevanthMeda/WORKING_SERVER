### Account and Authentication

#### Q: How do I create an account?
**A:** 
1. Click "Register" on the login page
2. Fill in your details (name, email, password, requested role)
3. Submit the registration form
4. Wait for admin approval
5. You'll receive an email when approved

1. Click "Forgot Password" on the login page
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for reset instructions
4. Follow the link to create a new password
5. Log in with your new password

#### Q: Why do I need to set up MFA?
**A:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an additional security layer by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account and sensitive report data.

#### Q: How do I set up MFA?
**A:**
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to Profile Settings → Security
3. Click "Enable MFA"
4. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
5. Enter the verification code from your app
6. Save the backup codes in a secure location

#### Q: My account is locked. What should I do?
**A:** Account lockouts typically occur after multiple failed login attempts. Wait 15 minutes and try again, or contact your system administrator for immediate assistance.

### Reports and Workflows

#### Q: How do I create a new report?
**A:**
1. Navigate to the Reports section
2. Click "New Report"
3. Fill in the basic information (title, reference, client, etc.)
4. Add test cases with descriptions and results
5. Upload supporting files if needed
6. Save as draft or submit for approval

#### Q: Can I edit a report after submitting it for approval?
**A:** No, once a report is submitted for approval, it cannot be edited by the creator. If changes are needed, the approver must reject the report, which returns it to draft status for editing.

#### Q: Who can approve my reports?
**A:** Users with Project Manager (PM) or Administrator roles can approve reports. Your organization may have specific approval workflows configured.

#### Q: What happens if my report is rejected?
**A:** When a report is rejected:
1. The report returns to "Draft" status
2. You receive an email notification
3. Rejection comments are provided by the reviewer
4. You can make necessary changes and resubmit

#### Q: How do I know when my report is approved?
**A:** You'll be notified through:
- Email notification
- In-app notification

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Login and Authentication Issues

#### Problem: Cannot log in with correct credentials
**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid email or password" error with correct credentials
- Login page keeps reloading
- Authentication seems to work but redirects back to login

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
   ```
   Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear browsing data
   Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear recent history
   Safari: Develop → Empty Caches
   ```

2. **Check Caps Lock and keyboard layout**
   - Ensure Caps Lock is off
   - Verify keyboard language settings
   - Try typing password in a text editor first

3. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
   - This eliminates browser extension conflicts
   - Tests if the issue is cache-related

4. **Disable browser extensions**
   - Ad blockers may interfere with authentication
   - Password managers might cause conflicts

5. **Check with system administrator**
   - Account may be locked or disabled
   - Password policy may have changed
   - System maintenance may be in progress

#### Problem: MFA code not working
**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid MFA token" error
- Authenticator app shows different code
- Backup codes don't work

**Solutions:**
1. **Check time synchronization**
   - Ensure device time is correct
   - TOTP codes are time-sensitive
   - Sync authenticator app time

2. **Try multiple codes**
   - TOTP codes change every 30 seconds
   - Wait for next code if current one fails
   - Don't reuse codes

3. **Use backup codes**
   - Each backup code works only once
   - Enter code exactly as provided
   - Contact admin if all codes used

4. **Reset MFA**
   - Contact system administrator
   - Provide identity verification
   - New QR code will be generated

### Report Creation and Management Issues

   - Document title: Maximum 200 characters
   - Client name: Maximum 100 characters
   - Purpose/Scope: Maximum 1000 characters

3. **Check permissions**
   - Ensure you have edit permissions
   - Report may be locked by another user
   - Status may prevent editing (approved reports)

4. **Try refreshing the page**
   - Browser may have lost connection
   - Session may have expired
   - Reload and try again

5. **Check network connection**
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Try from different network if possible
   - Check if other web services work

#### Problem: File upload fails

   # Verify file type is supported
   file filename.pdf
   ```

2. **Try different browser**
   - Some browsers handle large uploads better
   - Clear browser cache first
   - Disable browser extensions

3. **Check internet connection**
   - Large files require stable connection
   - Try uploading smaller files first
   - Consider using wired connection

4. **Compress files if possible**
   - Use ZIP compression for multiple files
   - Optimize images before upload
   - Convert documents to PDF

5. **Upload files individually**

   ```

2. **Verify token expiration**
   ```python
   import jwt
   import datetime
   
   # Decode token to check expiration
   decoded = jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})
   exp_time = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(decoded['exp'])
   print(f"Token expires: {exp_time}")
   ```

3. **Refresh token if expired**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/api/v1/auth/token/refresh" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer OLD_TOKEN"
   ```

       for attempt in range(max_retries):
           response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
           if response.status_code == 429:
               wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
               time.sleep(wait_time)
               continue
           return response
       raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
   ```

2. **Check rate limit headers**
   ```bash
   curl -I "https://api.example.com/api/v1/reports" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
   
   # Look for headers:
   # X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
   # X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
   # X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
   ```
