## Review Process

### For Authors
1. **Self-Review**: Review your own code before submitting
2. **Small PRs**: Keep pull requests small and focused
3. **Clear Description**: Provide clear PR description and context
4. **Address Feedback**: Respond to all review comments
5. **Update Tests**: Ensure tests are updated for changes

### For Reviewers
1. **Timely Reviews**: Review code within 24 hours
2. **Constructive Feedback**: Provide helpful, specific feedback
3. **Ask Questions**: Ask for clarification when needed
4. **Suggest Improvements**: Offer concrete suggestions
5. **Approve When Ready**: Don't hold up good code unnecessarily

## Code Quality Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 with line length of 127 characters
- Use Black for formatting
- Use isort for import organization
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Follow Google docstring style

### Naming Conventions
- **Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Functions**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private methods**: `_leading_underscore`

### Error Handling
```python
# Good
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise CustomException(f"Failed to process: {e}") from e

# Bad
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except:
    pass
```

### Logging
```python
# Good
logger.info("Processing report", extra={
    "report_id": report.id,
    "user_id": current_user.id,
    "correlation_id": g.correlation_id
})

# Bad
print(f"Processing report {report.id}")
```

### Database Queries
```python
# Good - Using ORM with proper filtering
reports = Report.query.filter(
    Report.user_id == user_id,
    Report.status == 'active'
).limit(100).all()

# Bad - Raw SQL without parameterization
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM reports WHERE user_id = {user_id}")
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Security Issues
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets
- Insufficient input validation
- Missing authentication/authorization checks

### Performance Issues
- N+1 query problems
- Missing database indexes
- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Blocking operations in async code

### Maintainability Issues
- Large functions or classes
- Deep nesting
- Duplicate code
- Poor variable names
- Missing error handling

### Testing Issues
- Missing test coverage
- Tests that don't actually test anything
- Flaky tests
- Tests that are too complex
- Missing edge case testing

## Tools and Automation

### Pre-commit Hooks
The project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically check:
- Code formatting (Black, isort)
- Linting (Flake8, Pylint)
- Security (Bandit)
- Type checking (mypy)
- Documentation style (pydocstyle)

### CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs:
- All quality checks
- Full test suite
- Security scanning
- Performance tests
- Deployment validation

### Quality Metrics
We track the following quality metrics:
- Code coverage (target: 80%+)
- Pylint score (target: 8.0+)
- Complexity metrics (Radon)
- Security vulnerabilities (Bandit, Snyk)
- Technical debt (SonarQube)
