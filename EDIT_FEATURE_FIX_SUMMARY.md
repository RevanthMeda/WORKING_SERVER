# Edit Feature Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing sat_wizard Route**
**Problem:** The edit.py file was redirecting to `reports.sat_wizard` but this route didn't exist in routes/reports.py.
**Fix:** Created the missing `sat_wizard` route in routes/reports.py that properly handles edit mode and loads existing report data.

### 2. **Duplicate edit_submission Functions**
**Problem:** In routes/main.py, there were two functions with the same route decorator `@main_bp.route('/edit/<submission_id>')`, causing conflicts.
**Fix:** Removed the incomplete duplicate function and kept the working implementation.

### 3. **Edit Button Visibility Logic**
**Problem:** The edit button in my_reports.html was correctly checking permissions but the route it linked to was broken.
**Fix:** The button logic was already correct, linking to `edit.edit_report` which now redirects to the working `sat_wizard` route.

## Fixed Code Components

### routes/reports.py
Added new route:
```python
@reports_bp.route('/sat/wizard')
@login_required
@role_required(['Engineer', 'Automation Manager', 'Admin'])
def sat_wizard():
    """SAT wizard route for editing existing reports"""
    # Handles loading existing report data for editing
    # Checks permissions and report lock status
    # Renders SAT.html with edit_mode=True
```

### routes/edit.py
The existing code correctly:
- Checks permissions with `can_edit_report()` function
- Redirects to `reports.sat_wizard` with edit parameters
- Handles saving edits with CSRF protection
- Manages version incrementing

### templates/my_reports.html
The template correctly:
- Shows edit button only for DRAFT and PENDING reports owned by the user
- Links to the correct edit route
- Displays editable/locked badges

## Edit Flow

1. **User clicks Edit button** in My Reports page
   - Button only appears for user's own DRAFT/PENDING reports
   - Links to `/reports/<report_id>/edit`

2. **Edit route processes request** (routes/edit.py)
   - Checks if user can edit (permissions, lock status)
   - Redirects to SAT wizard with edit mode

3. **SAT wizard loads** (routes/reports.py)
   - Fetches existing report data from database
   - Renders SAT.html form with populated data
   - Sets edit_mode=True flag

4. **User makes changes and saves**
   - Form submission handled by save_edit route
   - CSRF tokens validated
   - Version incremented
   - Changes saved to database

## Permission Rules Implemented

- **Admin:** Can edit any report (unless locked/approved)
- **Engineer:** Can edit own DRAFT/PENDING reports only
- **Automation Manager:** Can edit reports until PM approves
- **All users:** Cannot edit locked or APPROVED reports
