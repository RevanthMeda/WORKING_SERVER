# SAT Report Download Issue Fix

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing an issue where downloaded SAT reports were being saved as HTML files (`sat.html`) instead of proper DOCX files. When attempting to open these files, Microsoft Word would display an error message because it was trying to open HTML content as a Word document.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by one or more of the following factors:

1. **IIS Configuration**: The web server (IIS) was not properly handling MIME types for DOCX files
2. **Error Page Serving**: When download requests failed, IIS was serving HTML error pages instead of the actual DOCX files
3. **File Validation**: No validation was in place to ensure files were actually valid DOCX documents before serving
4. **Response Headers**: Inconsistent or missing proper MIME type headers in download responses

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced File Download Utility (`utils/file_download.py`)
Created a comprehensive utility module with the following features:
- **MIME Type Detection**: Proper MIME type mapping for Office documents
- **File Validation**: Validates file existence, size, and format integrity
- **DOCX Signature Verification**: Checks file headers to ensure valid DOCX format
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
- **Safe Download Function**: Centralized function for secure file downloads

### 2. Updated Download Routes (`routes/status.py`)
Modified both download endpoints to:
- Use the new safe file download utility
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Validate file integrity before serving
- Provide better error messages to users
- Handle edge cases gracefully

### 3. IIS Configuration Updates (`web.config`)
Enhanced the IIS configuration with:
- **MIME Type Mappings**: Explicit MIME type definitions for Office documents
- **Download URL Handling**: Special routing rules for download URLs to prevent HTML error pages
- **Compression Settings**: Disabled compression for download requests to prevent corruption
- **Header Management**: Proper header handling for file downloads

### 4. Key Improvements

#### File Validation
```python
def validate_file_integrity(file_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    # Checks file existence, size, and DOCX signature
    if file_path.lower().endswith('.docx'):
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
            header = f.read(4)
            if header != b'PK\x03\x04':  # ZIP/DOCX signature
                return False, "File is not a valid DOCX document"
```

#### MIME Type Handling
```python
office_mime_types = {
    '.docx': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document',
    '.xlsx': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet',
    '.pptx': 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation',
    # ... more types
}
```

#### IIS MIME Configuration
```xml
<staticContent>
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".docx" mimeType="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document" />
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".xlsx" mimeType="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" />
  <mimeMap fileExtension=".pptx" mimeType="application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation" />
</staticContent>
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart the Application
After implementing these changes, restart both the Flask application and IIS to ensure all configurations take effect.

### 2. Test Download Functionality
1. Generate a new SAT report
2. Navigate to the report status page
3. Click the download button
4. Verify that:
   - The file downloads with a `.docx` extension
   - The file opens correctly in Microsoft Word
   - No HTML content is present in the downloaded file

### 3. Check Application Logs
Monitor the application logs for the new debug information:
- File path and existence checks
- File size validation
- MIME type detection
- Download success/failure messages

### 4. Verify MIME Types
Use browser developer tools to check that download responses have the correct headers:
- `Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`
- `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="SAT_ProjectName.docx"`

## Troubleshooting

### If Downloads Still Fail
1. Check application logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that the `outputs` directory exists and has proper permissions
3. Ensure the Flask application has read access to generated DOCX files
4. Check IIS logs for any rewrite rule issues

### If Files Are Still HTML
1. Verify that the web.config changes were applied correctly
2. Check that IIS has been restarted after configuration changes
3. Test direct access to the Flask application (bypass IIS) to isolate the issue
4. Review IIS URL Rewrite module logs

### If Word Still Shows Errors
1. Check that the downloaded file actually has a `.docx` extension
2. Verify the file size is reasonable (> 1000 bytes)
3. Try opening the file with a different application to confirm it's not corrupted
4. Check the file's binary header to ensure it starts with the ZIP signature (`PK`)

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation prevents corrupted files from being served
2. **Better User Experience**: Clear error messages help users understand what went wrong
3. **Debugging Support**: Extensive logging helps diagnose issues quickly
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Proper MIME types ensure consistent behavior across browsers
5. **Security**: File validation prevents serving of potentially malicious content
6. **Maintainability**: Centralized utility functions make future updates easier

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional features:
1. **File Caching**: Cache generated reports to improve download performance
2. **Download Analytics**: Track download success/failure rates
3. **Multiple Format Support**: Allow downloads in PDF, HTML, or other formats
4. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate with antivirus scanning before serving files
5. **Access Control**: Enhanced permission checking for sensitive reports
